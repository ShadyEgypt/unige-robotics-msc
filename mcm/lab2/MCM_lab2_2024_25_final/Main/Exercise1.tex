% Write some intro

The second assignment of Modelling and Control of Manipulators focuses on manipulatorsâ€™ geometry and
direct kinematics. The aim of the lab is given a CAD model of an industrial 7 DoF manipulator give the initial transformation matrix, then implement in Matlab a method to compute the geometric model and the transformation matrices from the base to each joint. Finally, we have to implement a function which given the geometric model, the joint types and the number of joints can compute the Jacobian matrix of a generic serial manipulator.
